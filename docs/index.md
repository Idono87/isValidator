# What is isValidator

Is validator is a complete validation api built from the ground up for simple and fast validation with strong extensibility. isValidator is centered around 3 core pillars.

### - Ease of use
To easily defined constraints, validate and debug validation failures. 

### - User extensibility
The ability to extend the library with custom validation functionality beyond the default validation capabilities.

### - Strongly Typed
Since the library is written in TypeScript a big emphasis has been put on strongly typing the library and the validation process to catch any errors before running the application.
